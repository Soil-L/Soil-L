### Hi there 👋

😜 I am Liam! Welcome to visit my page!     
🎓 I am a student studying __Control Science & Control Engineer__.       
🚀 Control theory is what I consider as the key to manipulate the world!    
🤖 I am crazy about robotic technology, including perception, decision, planning, control and so on.    
🥳 In my spare time, I love reading, playing badminton, swimming and enjoy nature with my friends.
